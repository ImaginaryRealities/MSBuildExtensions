MSBuild Extensions
==================
The **gh-pages** branch contains the source code for the GitHub Pages website for the MSBuild Extensions project. The GitHub Pages website contains the documentation and announcements for this project.

Getting the Source Code
-----------------------
In order to download and view the source code for this website locally, you can clone the repository using [Git](http://git-scm.org). To create a clone of this repository, run the following command in a command prompt or terminal window:

    > git clone -b gh-pages --recursive git://github.com/ImaginaryRealities/MSBuildExtensions.git

This command will clone the repository, check out the **gh-pages** branch, and then initialize and load all of the submodules of this project.

Building the GitHub Pages Web Site
----------------------------------

### Prerequisites

In order to build the GitHub Pages Web Site, you will need to install the following software:

* [Ruby 1.9.3](http://www.ruby-lang.org)
* [Ruby DevKit](http://www.rubyinstaller.org)
* [Python 2.7.3](http://www.python.org)
* [Pygments](http://pygments.org)
* [Node.js 0.8.x](http://nodejs.org)

After installing the prerequisites, you will need to install [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and its dependencies using the Ruby **gem** tool:

    > gem install jekyll

In addition to the ruby gems, you will also need to use [NPM](http://npmjs.org) to install the following modules globally:

* **[less](http://www.lesscss.org)**
* **[coffee-script](http://coffeescript.org)**
* **[requirejs](http://requirejs.org)**

These modules can be installed by running the following command on the command line:

	> npm install -g <module-name>

where *module-name* is the name of one of the prerequisite packages listed above.

After installing everything, make sure that you add `C:\Python27` and `C:\Python27\Scripts` to your **PATH** environment variable.

### Building the Website

The GitHub Pages website uses [Ruby Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org) to automate the process of building the website. In order to build the website once all of the prerequisites are installed, you only need to run the following command from a command prompt window or PowerShell:

	> rake

The Rake build script exposes several top-level tasks that you can use to perform a specific action. The top-level tasks are described below:

<table width="100%">
	<tr>
		<th>Task</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>default</strong></td>
		<td>
			Builds the GitHub Pages website.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>clean</strong></td>
		<td>
			Removes all of the intermediate files that were generated by the build process, but does not remove the final website products.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>clobber</strong></td>
		<td>
			Removes all build-generated files and directories, including the final website products.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

In order to execute a task, you would use the following syntax on the command line:

	rake (default|clean|clobber)

As you saw earlier, the **default** task is used by default if you do not specify a task on the command line.

The output for the website will be generated and written to the **_site** subdirectory in the project workspace.

### Testing the Website

If you make changes to the website and want to test the changes locally, you can do so by running the HTTP server provided by Jekyll. To run the server, execute the following command in a command prompt window:

	> jekyll --pygments --no-lsi --safe --server

This command will regenerate all of the static content for the website (but will not generate the other components such as the JavaScript modules or the CSS stylesheets) and will launch an HTTP server on port 4000. You can view the website in a web browser by browsing to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

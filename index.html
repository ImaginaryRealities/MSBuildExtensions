<h1>Welcome to the MSBuild Extensions Project!</h1>
<p>
	This website contains the documentation, examples, news, and announcements for the ImaginaryRealities MSBuild Extensions project hosted on GitHub. If you are using our MSBuild extensions with your project, please check back here often for news and developments on this project.
</p>
<p>
	The MSBuild extensions are components that we have created and use to help build our open-source and commercial software products. These are tasks that are designed to fill holes in the MSBuild functionality, or to provide specific behaviors that we need for our automated build processes.
</p>
<p>
	We have released our MSBuild extensions under the MIT License. Please feel free to include these extensions in your own projects. For more information on the license, please see the <a href="license.html">licensing information page</a>.
